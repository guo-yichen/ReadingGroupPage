Welcome to the Numerical Analysis Reading Group in Virginia Tech!

We are several graduate students in the department of Mathematics in Virginia tech. 
The **Numerical Analysis Reading Group** aims to read and discuss interesting papers together. We read [Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice](http://www.chebfun.org/ATAP/) in 2022 Spring, and several [classic papers](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/classic_papers.txt) in 2022 Summer.

This fall, we are reading papers on Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra!
